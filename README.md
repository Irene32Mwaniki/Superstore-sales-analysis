# Superstore-sales-analysis
A dynamic Excel dashboard project analyzing Superstore sales data, and it has been a powerful exercise turning raw data into actionable insights. 

Problem Statement

The Superstore dataset contains thousands of transactions across multiple regions, categories, and customer segments—but decision-makers lack a clear, interactive view of performance trends. Without a centralized dashboard, it's difficult to:
  - Identify which product categories and sub-categories drive revenue vs. volume
  - Understand how shipping modes affect customer satisfaction and cost
  - Track regional and segment-level performance over time
  - Prioritize high-performing areas for strategic investment
What I built: 
- slicers for year, month, region, and segment to enable interactive filtering
Bar graph showing monthly sales trends
Line graph tracking quantity sold over time
Column chart comparing sub-categories 
Pie chart visualising shipping modes 
Tree map highlighting top-performing segments 
Radar chart comparing top categories

Excel skills applied: 
-	Advanced formula: VLOOKUP, offset, rank, sumifs 
-	Dynamic dashboard using slicers and linked charts
-	Data modelling with calculated fields and category-level aggregations
-	
Why this matters: 
This dashboard reflects my ability to synthesize complex datasets into clear, business-relevant insights. It also aligns with my philosophy of using data to inform equitable, efficient decision-making.
Insights from Analysis

Using Excel, I built a multi-layered dashboard that revealed:
  Technology is the top revenue-generating category, but Office Supplies lead in quantity sold—suggesting different pricing and margin dynamics.
  Consumer segment contributes the highest sales, while Corporate shows consistent performance across months.
  First Class shipping is preferred by high-value customers, but Second Class dominates overall volume—indicating a trade-off between speed and cost.
  Furniture sub-categories like tables and chairs show high variability in performance, requiring targeted marketing or inventory strategies.
  Monthly sales trends highlight seasonal spikes, useful for forecasting and promotional planning.

Solution

I designed an interactive Excel dashboard with:
Slicers for time, region, and segment filters
Visuals including bar, line, column, pie, treemap, and radar charts
Calculated fields using VLOOKUP, OFFSET, RANK, and aggregation functions
A layout optimized for clarity, storytelling, and decision-making

This dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore data dynamically, uncover trends, and make informed decisions without needing technical expertise.
